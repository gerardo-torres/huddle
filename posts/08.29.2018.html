    <h2>Ultra Chat</h2>

    <div class="date">August 29, 2018</div>
    
    <p>
        I've been learning a little bit about websockets and wanted to make a small
        project with this technology. A chat app is a perfect project to do for
        websockets since they're a very common feature in a lot of user-facing products.
        Additionally, it's a problem that can be solved with in multiple scales: ranging
        from a very simple websockets-based approach (which I am currently doing) to a
        production-ready app with security, realiability, and user-friendlyness in mind.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I wanted to have a cool UI but I realized that having a chat app in your terminal
        would require less resources and in my opinion is pretty cool.

        The above GIF shows an example between two users: Alice & Bob. There exists a
        single chatroom for now but in the future I hope to add the ability to create
        multiple chatrooms with different admin and member privalages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I used JavaScript and Node JS to build this with sockets.io as the websocket
        library as well as mongo db as the database to store user information.
