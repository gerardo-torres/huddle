        One of my friends tweeted that she wanted to redo her desk setup and asked
        people to share their setups so I thought I'd post my reply here too.

        I have a custom desk my dad and I made out of white oak with a teak oil finish
        for the top wood layer. I also have a whiteboard cuz I like to write stuff out
        and stick important documents on it with some magnets. I'm currently working on linear
        algebra homework (I hope I pass). Most of the stationary I own is either Muji or some 
        random Bic pens and pencils. I don't know where the plant is from, my friend gifted 
        it to me. I have a bunch more plants on my windows they're great.

        This is the keyboard that I use. It was a gift from about two years ago and it's 
        still going strong. It's an 80% Durgod Taurus K320 mechanical keyboard with 
        Cherry Brown switches. Idk much about mechanical keyboards but I like this one 
        a lot especially since it's really compact.

        I use an XPS 13 as my laptop and Ubuntu as my OS. I have the default GNOME desktop
        environment but I occasionally use i3. I'm looking to get into more tiling window 
        managers and while I really like them, I somehow still have a soft spot for floating
        windows. Also, whenever I show my screen to someone, it's hard for them to actually
        get around if I use i3 so I'm sticking with floating windows for now. I really like
        Ubuntu though!
